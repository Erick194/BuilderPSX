# Doom Builder PSX Based on GZDoom Builder (Bugfix) by [GEC]

This fork is intended to create maps for Psx Doom.
Exclusive to Psx Doom, **[Psx Doom Master Edition](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/101161/)** and **[PsyDoom](https://github.com/BodbDearg/PsyDoom)**  by **[BodbDearg](https://github.com/BodbDearg)**.

This release includes the following configurations:
* Doom: PsxDoom (PsxDoom format)
* Doom: PsxDoom (Master Edition)
* Doom: PsxDoom (PsyDoom extensions)

The last two points, have disabled the stretching of textures and can render the sky for the floors.

The configuration for PsyDoom was taken from the following Commit by @BodbDearg: [Provide a GZDoom builder config to expose PsyDoom extensions to PSX Doom](https://github.com/BodbDearg/PsyDoom/commit/3084a9e4d9b2d7c1ac5d224fba1949674efb12d4#diff-fb52bb6c0dba0a4f8180fda0a718ecb454e7c0a17ce35f4f87abf63668f6f6e7)
